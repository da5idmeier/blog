# The Centralization of Entertainment

Dear Millenials, 

These are some ideas about what we were left with, in terms of the physical reality we find ourselves in.

The last few generations of humans grew up in a reality where entertainment was broadcasted to you, through radio or television.
Content was created, curated, industries born to service humans by providing entertainment, alievating you with the responsibility 
to entertain. Their stories became our stories and we told those stories amongst ourselves, regurgitating entertainment that was
curated for us to converse about. 

[Experiencing life became too expensive for a large population, so now we must broadcast experiences
to your homes, so you can consume it rather than live it.]

Once entertainment was an industry that could service human beings, now a business model was required to keep the machine going.
The value entertainment brings is the attention of the human being. A human being's attention is the most valuable thing we 
have on this planet and the war for that attention is so much greater than I think most of you understand. This is the
Banksy message you will never spend any time thinking about. Entertainment as a service allowed corporations to sell your
attention to businesses, and this led to the advertisement industry - a vial and horrific exploitation of human behaviors.

It is my belief that human beings must entertain for each other, we must perform for each other. This allows us to feel 
connected to each other. We can not ground our truths in "entertainment-as-a-service", we must understand the importance
of the human connection. 

The 3 principles i use to design technology are to help humans feel: safe, **connected** and empowered. 

This is where I find meaning in being an engineer, and that is important to me. I hope that is also important to you.
