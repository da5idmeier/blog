# the straddle of time

it is the year 2021. the pandemic is still killing, 100 million infected with a 3% mortality rate. [i had to pause to remind myself if i was writing non-fiction or fiction.]
as a product of the 80s i sit atop a perspective i never thought i would see, after 35 years in this reality: observing, learning and actively engaged you reach a level of
understanding from number of hours put in, you have seen enough people and interacted with enough human beings where you understand well enough the potential possibilities
of humans but also come to understand the reality of chaos theory and that the only thing that makes sense in this reality, is that nothing really makes sense. i sit at a keyboard
typing this into a piece of software that will present it to a platform with billions of human beings connected to it. me, just a silly old primate who managed to eat enough protein
to evolve with thumbs, *shrug*, it was not my doing. i merely exist here in this physical reality, with you, attempting to connect, attempting to find ways to allow ourselves
to feel vulnerable, experience life, explore our passions and exist in the way that we choose.
