**the straddle of time**

**equipment**: technics sl1200-mk2, a mixer i want to take a bat to, and a set of krk5 monitors
**vinyl**: jungle brothers - straight out the jungle
**drink**: black tea, a splash of ACV, 'cause we like the funk
**format**: raw

it is the year 2021. the pandemic is still killing, 100 million infected with a 3% mortality rate. [i had to pause to remind myself if i was writing non-fiction or fiction.]
as a product of the 80s i sit atop a perspective i never thought i would see, after 35 years in this reality: observing, learning and actively engaged you reach a level of
understanding from number of hours put in. you have seen enough people and interacted with enough human beings where you understand well enough the potential possibilities
of humans but also come to understand the reality of chaos theory and that the only thing that makes sense in this reality, is that nothing really makes sense. 

i sit at a keyboard typing this into a piece of software that will present it to a platform with billions of human beings connected to it. me, just a silly old primate who managed to eat enough protein to evolve with thumbs, or evolve the gut biome so that we could process fermented fruits, thanks liver! *shrug*, it was not my doing. i merely exist here in this physical reality, with you, attempting to connect, attempting to find ways to allow ourselves to feel vulnerable, experience life, explore our passions and exist in the way that we choose. 

...

let that breathe. 

ok, cool.

i choose to be cyberpunk. i believe technology has the potential to help humanity feel: safe, connected and empowered and i use these principles to work towards a future where
technology is honored and understood to be a tool to free humanity and not a tool to enslave it. we must stop taking it for granted. we must stop allowing others to do things for us. dont want to create your own computer architecture? or use risc-v (*winky face*) - oh i will just buy it from an ARM licensee, i will use an operating system that
someone else wrote and i no longer control, i will use word processor software that i did not write, i will let others manage my networks and major services like email, web
site, and real-time communication platforms. all of these things can be written by us, for us. we can organize ourselves, to complete tasks for each other, instead of for
corporations. all major utilities and infrastructure should be a federal budget, socialized healthcare is a no-brainer! NAME SOMEONE YOU WISH DID NOT HAVE HEALTHCARE? FOR REAL?
that is an evil that can not be understood in a lifetime, to convince a population that human beings, all of us, do not deserve to be taken care of when the biological systems
we inhabit are broken. that is evil. that is suffering, and it is not necessary. we can do better. we can all work towards a future where we control our own lives again, we
farm our own foods, we share our crops, we share our bounties, and we continue to evolve and enrichen our lives with technology by ensuring that we are in control of the
technology first, we set the principles, we think deeply about its direction and do not allow the greed of corporations to push us into a future we have not adequately prepared
for. 

i choose vinyl. i choose to understand how to be my own DJ and play things that i want to hear, set the environment i want to set, at least for a period of time. playing
music for others is an angel's voice, it is a way for humans to connect, especially those that have a few tire marks across their faces, like yours truly. you are setting the bpm, 
you are setting the clock at which you want everyone else to try and resonate with you, there is meaning in the music but there is also just a primal frequency where you attempt
to match and use to connect with others operating at the same frequency. to exist in space and time along the same clock, it is itself a beauty that which must be experienced,
but is it confined to only physical reality? is it possible to feel the same connection with a human being through immersive technology and future haptics options. as time sends
you propelling forward, without choice, along with everyone around you, what is a memory? what is an experience? can you have a memory of a (virtual) experience that is as
powerful or more than one from the physical reality alone?
